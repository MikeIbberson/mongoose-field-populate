<h1>ðŸ’« Mongoose field-level autopopulate plugin</h1>

</p>
<p>This package ships with a very basic autopopulation feature. The most common solution on NPM does not suit my needs, though it might fit nicely into your project. Use this only if you require autopopulation on discriminators or embedded arrays.</p>
